In healthcare, it is a common practice for doctors to provide written orders to refer patients to other healthcare providers. Referrals are crucial to ensure that patients receive appropriate care.
Here, there is a social network where each node represents a physician and edges represent the reference to another physician.

Aim: find the most connected physician and identity group of physicians who refer to each other more frequently.
